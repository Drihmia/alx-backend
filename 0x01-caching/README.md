# Caching system
A caching system is a system that stores data in a cache. A cache is a temporary storage area where data is stored so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache (cache hit), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise (cache miss), the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower.

# FIFO
FIFO stands for First In, First Out. It is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure where the first element added to the structure is the first one to be removed. This is analogous to a queue, where the first person to enter the queue is the first person to leave it.

# LIFO
LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure where the last element added to the structure is the first one to be removed. This is analogous to a stack, where the last item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.

# LRU
LRU stands for Least Recently Used. It is a caching algorithm that evicts the least recently used items from the cache when the cache reaches its capacity. This algorithm assumes that items that have been accessed recently are more likely to be accessed again in the near future.

# MRU

MRU stands for Most Recently Used. It is a caching algorithm that evicts the most recently used items from the cache when the cache reaches its capacity. This algorithm assumes that items that have been accessed recently are less likely to be accessed again in the near future.

# LFU
LFU stands for Least Frequently Used. It is a caching algorithm that evicts the least frequently used items from the cache when the cache reaches its capacity. This algorithm assumes that items that have been accessed less frequently are less likely to be accessed again in the near future.

# Purpose of a caching system

The purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data in a cache. By storing data in a cache, the system can reduce the time and resources required to retrieve the data from its original storage location. This can result in faster response times, reduced latency, and improved overall system performance.

# Limits of a caching system

Caching systems have several limitations, including:

1. Cache size: Caching systems have a limited amount of storage space available for caching data. If the cache reaches its capacity, it may need to evict older or less frequently used items to make room for new data.

2. Cache consistency: Caching systems may face challenges in maintaining consistency between the cached data and the original data source. If the original data is updated or modified, the cached data may become stale or outdated.

3. Cache invalidation: Caching systems need to implement mechanisms to invalidate or refresh cached data when it becomes outdated or no longer valid. This can be challenging, especially in distributed or multi-tiered caching systems.

4. Cache eviction policies: Caching systems need to implement eviction policies to determine which items to evict from the cache when it reaches its capacity. Choosing the right eviction policy can be complex and may impact the overall performance of the system.

5. Cache hit ratio: Caching systems need to monitor and optimize the cache hit ratio, which is the percentage of requests that are served from the cache. A low cache hit ratio can indicate that the caching system is not effectively caching frequently accessed data.

Overall, caching systems are a powerful tool for improving the performance and efficiency of data retrieval, but they also have limitations that need to be carefully considered and managed.
